    "## Jupyter and around\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter ecosystem evolved to make computing **interactive, reproducible, and shareable**. It began with [IPython](https://ipython.org), an enhanced Python shell for rapid experimentation, and expanded into [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) to support multiple languages through a decoupled kernel-interface model. [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) introduced a web-based environment combining code, outputs, and narrative text, ideal for teaching, research, and data analysis. [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org) provides a modern, flexible workspace for managing notebooks, scripts, and data in complex projects. Finally, [Jupyter{book}](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html) allows structured, publication-quality books and websites to be built from notebooks and Markdown, fully executable and shareable. Together, these tools address the need for **interactive coding, reproducibility, multi-language support, and clear communication of computational results**, even beyond Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org)** is an open-source project that evolved from [IPython](https://ipython.org). IPython originally provided an enhanced interactive Python shell, with powerful features like introspection, rich media, and tab-completion, making Python more user-friendly for experimentation and data analysis. Jupyter extended this idea to **multiple programming languages** (Python, R, Julia, and more) by separating the **kernel** (which executes code) from the **interface** (which displays results interactively).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org)** builds on this foundation, providing a web-based interactive environment where users can write and execute code, display rich outputs (plots, images, LaTeX, widgets), and combine them with narrative text. This allows notebooks to serve as **reproducible documents** for data analysis, teaching, and scientific communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)** is the next-generation interface for Jupyter, offering a **modular, flexible environment** where users can work with notebooks, text editors, terminals, and data files all in one workspace. It improves productivity for complex projects, supports extensions, and makes multi-document workflows smoother than classic notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[Binder/MyBinder](https://mybinder.org/)** is a cloud service that allows users to **launch fully executable Jupyter environments** directly from GitHub repositories. It lets anyone run notebooks or Jupyter Books without installing anything locally, making content fully interactive and reproducible online.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[Jupyter{book}](https://jupyterbook.org/)** extends the Jupyter ecosystem by allowing users to turn **collections of notebooks and Markdown files into interactive, publication-quality books and websites**. Unlike standalone notebooks, Jupyter Books provide structured chapters, table-of-contents, cross-references, and can be executed to show live outputs, making them ideal for teaching, tutorials, and reproducible scientific publications.\n",
