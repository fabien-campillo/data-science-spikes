    "# Electrophysiology Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Accessing electrophysiology records can be difficult, and working with them is often cumbersome, as they typically require specific formats to be quickly accessible and usable. To make data more widely available, it is crucial to develop not only open-access databases but also standardized file formats. Historically, data formats were tied to the devices that generated them—often proprietary and incompatible with other systems. This fragmentation soon became a barrier to scientific progress. In what follows, we first introduce common file formats, then present several relevant databases, and finally show how to work with them in Python.\n"

    "## Types of Electrophysiology Recordings\n",
    "\n",
    "Electrophysiology covers a wide range of recording techniques, each suited to different biological questions.  \n",
    "Here are the main categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Intracellular Recordings** - *Sharp electrode recordings*: measure the membrane potential inside a single cell • *Whole-cell patch clamp*: provides detailed access to ionic currents, membrane potential, and synaptic inputs • *Single-channel recordings*: resolve the activity of individual ion channels.  \n",
    "- **Extracellular Recordings** -  *Single-unit recordings*: detect action potentials (“spikes”) from individual neurons using fine electrodes • *Multi-unit recordings*: capture spikes from small groups of neurons near the electrode tip • *Multi-electrode arrays (MEA)*: record from dozens to thousands of electrodes simultaneously across a neural population.  \n",
    "-  **Field Potential Recordings** - *Local field potentials (LFPs)*: measure summed synaptic activity and slower fluctuations in a local region • *ECoG (electrocorticography)*: records field potentials directly from the cortical surface.  \n",
    "- **Non-Invasive Recordings** - *EEG (electroencephalography)*: scalp recordings of brain activity with high temporal resolution • *MEG (magnetoencephalography)*: detects magnetic fields generated by neuronal currents.  \n",
    "- **Other Specialized Methods** - *EMG (electromyography)*: records muscle activity • *ERG (electroretinography)*: records retinal responses to light •  *Patch-clamp in slices/in vivo*: advanced combinations allowing intracellular access in complex preparations.\n",
