    "## Using Virtual Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use a Virtual Environment in Python?  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem without a virtual environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "- By default, when you install a library with `pip install`, it goes into the **system-wide Python**.  \n",
    "- Risks:  \n",
    "  - ⚠️ Version conflicts between projects (e.g., one project needs `numpy==1.20`, another `numpy==1.26`).  \n",
    "  - ⚠️ Risk of breaking system tools that rely on Python (macOS and Homebrew depend on it).  \n",
    "  - ⚠️ Environment quickly polluted with dozens of unnecessary packages.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution: Virtual Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "A virtual environment = an **isolated copy of Python** with its own libraries.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:  \n",
    "- Project-by-project isolation.  \n",
    "- No conflicts between library versions.  \n",
    "- Easier to share and reproduce a project (`requirements.txt` or `environment.yml`).  \n",
    "- You can delete a project without polluting the system.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Two Main Choices: `venv` vs `conda`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`venv` (native Python virtual environments)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Included in Python (`python -m venv myenv`).  \n",
    "- Lightweight, simple to use.  \n",
    "- Package management via `pip install`.  \n",
    "- Good for:  \n",
    "  - Lightweight projects (Flask, Django, scripts).  \n",
    "  - General development.  \n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ Limitations:  \n",
    "- `pip` installs only Python libraries.  \n",
    "- Some heavy libraries (numpy, scipy, torch, tensorflow…) may require compilation → possible errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda` (Anaconda/Miniconda environments)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Also creates isolated environments (`conda create -n myenv python=3.10`).  \n",
    "- Can install not only Python libraries, but also **system dependencies** (BLAS, MKL, CUDA, etc.).  \n",
    "- Precompiled package distribution → fast and reliable installation.  \n",
    "- Good for:  \n",
    "  - Data science and machine learning (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow).  \n",
    "  - Multi-language projects (Python + R + CUDA…).  \n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ Limitations:  \n",
    "- Heavier than `venv`.  \n",
    "- Package management can be slightly slower at times.  \n",
